# Simulation-Based Visualisation and Evaluation Based Pipeline 

This project aims to address challenges in evaluating current state-of-the-art approaches in robotic grasp planning. To overcome this, a simulation-based pipeline was developed, providing visualisation and evaluation of grasp planning approaches.

## Installation 

All code was developed with Python 3.10

Python requirements can be installed on your local device by: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

To evaluate grasp planning approaches with this pipeline, they need to be integrated, as with GG-CNN (Morrison, Corke and Leitner, 2019). With minor tweaks (if required), the approach can be visualised, without required parameters used in the main.py file
